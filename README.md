KeepSafe
========

KeepSafe: KeepSafe is Android app aimed at improving the user's safety. In the event that a user is kidnapped or has had an emergency, and isn't responding to urgent calls from his/her friends and family, upon receiving a coded SMS from a predefined the set of SOS contacts, the app is activated. It immediately puts the phone into silent mode, and forces the gps and data connection on.  The user's location is determined, and an audio recording of the surrounding is recorded. At the same time, an image is taken from the front and back camera. These are bundled together, compressed and sent to predefined SOS contacts as an attachment to an email. The entire process is automated and occurs without any interaction from the user.
